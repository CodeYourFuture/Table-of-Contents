## Naming things
Repos are of these types and you should prefix the type or your repo might be deleted in the future

1. Module
2. Course
3. Project
4. Workshop
5. Product
7. Ops
8. Temporary
9. Alum

### Module Repos
Each module should have its own coursework repo. The naming structure for mandatory work _should_ be consistent
- **Coursework** https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Name
- **Solution Guides** should be stored in a solutions branch on the repo
There is a template repo to help us do this:
