## Module Repos
Each week in the Syllabus should have its own coursework repo. The naming structure for mandatory work _should_ be consistent
- **Coursework** https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Name-Coursework-Week1
- **Coursework Solutions** https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Name-Coursework-Week1-Solution
- **Classwork** https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Name-Classwork-Week1 _CAN YOU HELP BUILD THIS?_
- **Classwork Solutions** https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Name-Classwork-Week1-Solution _CAN YOU HELP BUILD THIS?_
There are template repos to help us do this: 
- https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Coursework-Template 
- https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Classwork-Template

We are (over 2022) building a module project for each module. These will be named like this:
- https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Name-Module-Project
- https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Name-Module-Project-Solution
